Thanks for giving this a read! We're always open to your contributions.
This document will get you started on how to contribute and the things you
should know. So please give it (and our code-of-conduct) a thorough read.

## How do I contribute code?

1.  Find some issue you're interested in, or a feature that you'd like to tackle.
    Also make sure that no one else is already working on it. We don't want you
    to be disappointed.

2.  Fork this repo into your own GitHub, then clone.

3.  Create a branch with a meaningful name for the issue:
    `git checkout -b adds-better-filtering`

4.  Make your changes and commit: `git add` and `git commit`

5.  Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-branch-name`

6.  Submit a pull request to our upstream repository.

7.  Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.

8.  Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, make changes if it's being
    recommended, and get it merged.

9.  Hooray!
